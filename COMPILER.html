<center> The implemented compiler is designed to accept certain parameters in to the computer's memory, process the input and produce the output of the process <br/>

The compiler should allow the implied operator precedence or hierarchy associated expressions like: 7 + 4 * 6,<br/> the operation must start with multiplication then be followed by addition.<br/> With the rules of the pop and push of the stack.
The BNF of the operations is written by < expression>::= < term>[< mulop>< term>]*
<hr/>
<p> <font color="red"><i><ins> general expressions </font></ins></i></p>
The expression is able to handle any degree of complexity or any number of terms,<br/> and it makes the incremental approach possible.<br/> The BNF of the expression is written by < expression>::=< term>[< mulop>< term>]*

<p> <font color="red"><i><ins> stack </font></ins></i></p>
The parenthesis forces addition before multiplication, and give us a mechanism for defining expressions of any degree of complexity.<br/> The BNF explaining the parenthesis notation is written by < factor> ::= (< expression>).<br/>
This is where the recursion comes in where an expression can contain a factor which contains another expression which contains a factor.<br/>The stack enables us to know the memory number at which the data is stored.<br/>
Example : if we put 7 in D1 the next number goes to the next memory is which is D2.<br/> The solution of pushing the data in to the stack is written by â€“(SP) and for popping is written by (SP)+

The compiler is hosted on github and left as an open source for everyone to be able to edit it </font>
